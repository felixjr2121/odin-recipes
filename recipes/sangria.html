        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This authentic sangria recipe is a terrific version of the popular wine drink. 
            You can add any fruit that you want, but I find that apples and pears absorb all the rum. 
            This one is not diluted with carbonated beverages. 
            I have much success with red Burgundy wine and white rum, 
            though spiced run is nice too.</p>
