    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you love coffee I urge you to try any coffee lover's dream 
            cocktail...Espresso Martini! Techinically it's not a true martini 
            classic French Martini because it doesn't contain any gin or 
            vermouth but it's served in traditional martini glasses and has 
            become just as iconic.</p>
        <p>It's strong but sweet, rich, smooth, and utterly delicious it's 
            pretty much like your after-dinner coffee, liqeur, and dessert 
            all in one. If an Irish Coffee is your thing you're guranteed to 
            love this! The best part is how quick and easy it is to make, 
            all you need is four easy ingredients and a cocktail shaker.</p>
        <p>If you want to impress at your next dinner party serve this 
            alongside your dessert to really blow your guests away or serve 
            it at the start of the night to really kick things off!</p>
    
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Coffee - make sure to use strong espresso coffee preferably 
            brewed in a machine with plenty of froth! Avoid using instant 
            coffee.</li>
        <li>Kahlua - this is a wonderful coffee and rum liqeur that 
            tastes amazing. It really gives this cocktail the best flavor.</li>
        <li>Vodka - use your favorite vodka here. It doesn't need to be 
            expensive!</li>
        <li>Simple syrup - this is used to sweeten the cocktail and 
            mellow the flavors of the strong coffee and vodka. 
            You can buy simple syrup in bottles or make it by bringing 
            equal amounts of water and sugar to a boil then leaving it 
            to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Coffee beans - these are a traditional and fun garnish but 
            not necessary for taste.</li>
    </ul>
